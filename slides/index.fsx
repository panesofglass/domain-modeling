# Objective

## Visualize distance between two cities by their geographic coordinates.

***

# Process

*)

(*** include: distance-calculator-example ***)

(**

' This pipeline shows that we want to take a list of two Cities as inputs,
' translate those cities into locations,
' and finally calculate the distance (in feet).

***

# Goal 1

## Define `City`

***

## Simplest thing possible (C#)

    [lang=cs]
    using City = string;

***

## Simplest thing possible (F#)

*)

module Alias =
    type City = string

(**
***

## Does this really help?

' Maybe: you get better documentation throughout your code;
' however, you don't get any type safety.

***

## Can we do better?

***

## Single-cased union types

*)

module SingleCase =
    type City = City of string

(** Extract the value via pattern matching: *)
    let city = City "Houston, TX"
    let cityName (City name) = name
    let result = cityName city

(** Value of result: *)
(*** include-value: result ***)

(**
***

# Goal 2

## Define a `Location` type

***

## `Place` type (C#)

    [lang=cs]
    public interface ILocatable {
        float Latitude { get; }
        float Longitude { get; }
    }

    public class Place : ILocatable {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public float Latitude { get; set; }
        public float Longitude { get; set; }
    }

***

## `Place` type (F#)

*)

type ILocatable =
    abstract Latitude : float
    abstract Longitude : float

module FirstTry =

    type Place =
        { Name : string
          Latitude : float
          Longitude : float }
        interface ILocatable with
            member this.Latitude = this.Latitude
            member this.Longitude = this.Longitude

(**
***

## What could go wrong?

1. Latitude or longitude not provided
2. Latitude and longitude mixed up
3. Invalid city and location values

***

## 1. Handling missing values

Examples:

* Atlantis
* Camelot

***

## C# version:

    [lang=cs]
    class Locatable : ILocatable {
        public float Latitude { get; set; }
        public float Longitude { get; set; }
    }

    public class Place {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public float? Latitude { get; set; }
        public float? Longitude { get; set; }
        public ILocatable GetLocation() {
            if (Latitude.HasValue && Longitude.HasValue) {
                return new Locatable {
                    Latitude = Latitude.Value,
                    Longitude = Longitude.Value
                };
            } else {
                return null; // Oh noes!
            }
        }
    }

***

## F# `Place` with optional `ILocatable`

*)

module OptionalLocation =

    type Place =
        { Name : string
          Latitude : float option
          Longitude : float option }
        member this.GetLocation() : ILocatable option =
            match this.Latitude, this.Longitude with
            | Some lat, Some lng ->
                { new ILocatable with
                    member this.Latitude = lat
                    member this.Longitude = lng } |> Some
            | _ -> None

(**
***

## Yuck, right?

***

## Can we do better?

***

## Rethinking `ILocatable`

### "Is-a" vs. "Has-a"

***

## `Latitude` and `Longitude` belong together

***

## Refactored `Place` type (C#)

    [lang=cs]
    public class Location {
        public float Latitude { get; set; }
        public float Longitude { get; set; }
    }

    public class Place {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public Location Location { get; set; }
    }

***

## Note: "optional" indicated by a `null`

***

## Refactored `Place` type (F#)

*)

module Revised =

    type Location = { Latitude : float; Longitude : float }

    type Place = { Name : string; Location : Location option }

(**
***

## Note: No `null`

***

## Has-a preferred to Is-a

### "Composition over inheritance"

***

## 2. Mixing up latitude and longitude

***

## Sadly we will have to leave C# behind

***

## Units of measure

*)

(*** include: location-measure-types ***)

(**
***

## Correct `Location`

*)

(*** include: location2 ***)

(**
***

## Make invalid values impossible

***

## Types can only get you so far

1. `City` allows `null` and `""`
2. `Location` allows latitude < -90 and > 90
3. `Location` allows longitude < -180 and > 180

***

## 3. Valid values

***

## Revisiting `City`

*)

(*** include: city ***)

(**

' Without a city lookup, we are stuck with a minimal
' validation for the city name. We could add a bit
' more, such as requiring one or more commas, but
' this provides the general idea.

***

## Better than nothing

***

## Revisiting `Location`

*)

(*** include: location ***)

(**

' This may look strange as we are now hiding
' the record we previously used. However, we
' retain immutability and add validation.

***

## Revisiting `Place`

*)

(*** include: place ***)

(**
***

## `Place` still has yet to change

### Single Responsibility Principle

' Place doesn't really change except to swap
' Name : string for Name : City
' This is exactly the goal of SRP.

***

## Further study: Contracts and Dependent Types

* [Code Contracts](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/)
* [F*](https://fstar-lang.org/)
* [TS*](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nswamy/papers/tstar.pdf)
* [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/)

' We have seen that the F# type system can
' get us pretty far along our way. 
' We had to resort to constructor functions
' to provide more rigid validation.

' Note that we can still create an invalid `City`.
' However, if we privatize the union, we can't
' retrieve the name via pattern matching.

' Some languages offer additional type system
' constructs to do these validations. Code contracts,
' originally from Eiffel, offer one form of this.
' Newer languages have also been working on a concpt
' called dependent types or refinement types. These
' allow you to further specify the range of values
' allowed, as we have done above using our
' constructor functions. I've listed a few examples
' in case you wish to study these further.

***

# Goal 3: Processing Requests

***

## Process

*)

(*** include: distance-calculator-example ***)

(**

' This pipeline shows that we want to take a list of two Cities as inputs,
' translate those cities into locations,
' and finally calculate the distance (in feet).

***

## How do we translate?

* UI input: two cities
* Calculation input: two geographic coordinates
* Unit conversion: meters -> feet

***

## Start with types

*)

(*** include: workflow-process-types ***)

(**
***

## Implementation

***

## Retrieving values from other sources

' For the purposes of our demo application,
' let's assume we have a database of city names
' with their corresponding geographic coordinates.
' We will use the FSharp.SqlClient type provider
' to provide us the types we need to access the data.

' Why not use a third-party service such as Google Maps?
' I thought of doing this, but I wanted to keep this
' example close to what we are actually doing at Tachyus.
' Also, the SqlClient type providers are really quite cool,
' and I like showing it off. It's also a way we can
' further constrain the available cities, should we have
' time to explore that.

***

## [FSharp.Data.SqlClient](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data.SqlClient/)

***

## Type-checked SQL

*)

(*** include: sql-command-provider ***)

(**

' Show how this works and that invalid SQL
' immediately causes compiler errors.
' Discuss that this erases to raw ADO.NET
' so performance is excellent.

***

## Lookup coordinates by city name

*)

(*** include: lookup-locations ***)

(**

***

## Calculate Distance

*)

(*** include: find-distance ***)

(**

' System.Device.Location.GeoCoordinate has a method
' that uses the Haversine formula, which assumes a
' spherical earth. We could implement this ourselves,
' but why bother when it's already available?

***

## Unit conversion

*)

(*** include: units-of-measure ***)
(*** include: meters-to-feet ***)

(**

' Similar to what we saw above, we apply units of measure
' to ensure our results are what we intended. Note that
' here we create a conversion function to handle the conversion.

***

## Wrapping up the steps

*)

(*** include: distance-calculator-pipeline ***)

(**

' Here we use function composition and rely on type
' inference to create a single function to run our
' workflow.

***

## What about `Show`?

' We introduced a Show type with the other workflow types.
' Where is it? How do we get to the Show step? Doesn't it
' break from the process we defined at the outset?
' How are we going to bridge the gap?

***

# Goal 4: Visualizing Results

***

## What do we need to do?

1. Serialize data for display in a browser
2. Define HTTP resources to process requests
3. Render the UI

***

## 1. Serialization

***

## Serialized data should also send `Place`s

***

## Bridging the gap

*)

(*** include: distance-workflow ***)

(**

' Here we create a mutually recursive function definition,
' with each function calling the next step in succession.
' Note that these essentially wrap the functions we defined
' above and thread through the additional state we want to
' make available at the end. We also introduce the showPlaces
' function that will serialize the results for us.

***

## Defunctionalization

' Not everyone likes the mutually recursive function approach.
' It works, and in some cases it is the best and right solution.
' However, you can defunctionalize this solution to use
' discriminated unions and a single recursive function to process
' the same workflow.

***

## Defining state machine `Stage`s

*)

(*** include: stages ***)

(**
***

## Process `Stage`s recursively

*)

(*** include: processing-stages ***)

(**
***

## Output: JSON

    {
        "start": {
            "name": "Houston, TX",
            "location": {
                "latitude": 29.760427,
                "longitude": -95.369803
            }
        },
        "dest": {
            "name": "San Mateo, CA",
            "location": {
                "latitude": 31.700148,
                "longitude": -106.275785
            }
        },
        "distance": 3493771.738857
    }

***

## 2. Define HTTP resources

* MVC
* Web API
* ?

***

## Is it possible to model HTTP itself?

***

## This is HTTP

<img src="images/http-state-diagram.png" alt="HTTP State Machine" />

***

## Freya

<img src="images/freya.svg" alt="Freya logo" height="300px" width="300px" style="background-color:#fff;" />

***

## Freya Machines = HTTP Resources

*)

(*** include: resource ***)

(**
***

## Machine Composition!

*)

(*** include: http-config-common ***)

(**

' We are literally mixing in existing graphs into our
' resource definitions. We have a well-typed, well-
' specified HTTP implementation that allows us to map
' our domain into the world of HTTP, and we get the
' compiler to help us out!

***

## That's nice, but how do we map the domain?

***

## Parse the query string for cities

*)

(*** include: parse-query-string ***)

(**

***

## Define the GET handler

*)

(*** include: get-handler ***)

(**
***

## 3. Show and Tell

<form id="calc-form">
    <label for="start">Start City</label>
    <input type="text" id="start" name="start" /><br />
    <label for="dest">Destination</label>
    <input type="text" id="dest" name="dest" /><br />
    <button type="button" id="calculate">Calculate Distance</button>
</form>

<label for="show-result">Result</label>

# Review

***

## 1. Make invalid states impossible

' The ultimate goal of leveraging a type system should
' be to make invalid states impossible. If you use types
' only for documentation, then you are likely just adding
' noise to your code. Leverage the compiler to cover as
' many of your test cases as possible and avoid the pain
' of debugging or scrambling to fix a production issue.

' Perhaps the best example of where developers failed
' was the Mars Climate Orbiter, which was lost because
' of a units error. https://d2cj35nmzi9erd.cloudfront.net/msp98/news/mco990930.html

***

## 2. Provide types from external sources

' In many cases, code generation is an excellent tool for
' ensuring you stay in lockstep with an external dependency.
' F#'s type providers kick this up a notch, providing types
' without generating code you have to maintain, in some cases
' erasing the types in the compiled output for better performance.

***

## 3. Declare your app's state machine

' We looked at this when we created the mutually recursive
' workflow function and the defunctionalized Stage type and
' runWorkflow function. This can tie everything together for
' you at the top level and ensure you don't accidentally
' re-order your function calls.

***

## 4. Even "untyped" protocols can benefit from types

' HTTP is about as untyped as they come when it comes to protocols.
' It's incredibly extensible and is often represented as a simple
' dictionary with string keys. However, that doesn't mean you have
' to just accept that a compiler can't help you. Protocols define
' at least some level of expectation that you can expect, so
' leverage as much through your types as you can.

' F#'s computation expressions prove to be an incredible asset
' for such problems. The Freya machine library provides a typed,
' pluggable DSL for working with HTTP. It's pretty incredible.
' One doesn't often think of mixins and static typing going hand-
' in-hand, but Freya clearly shows it's possible, and you gain a
' lot more safety from both the checked types and defined state
' machine than were you to try to re-encode the HTTP protocol
' again and again every time you want to build a web app.

***

## 5. Types can't always get you all the way

' Despite the extent to which we were able to add compile-time
' type checking throughout this little sample, we also saw
' a few cases where types were not able to help us, at least
' not in C# or F#. Some other languages and tools are paving
' the way for improvements, though, and perhaps we'll eventually
' see things like refinement and dependent types in .NET.

' Network interruptions, external dependencies, and more are
' still outside the scope of nearly all type systems. We have
' a long way to go, but we should at least start leveraging
' what we have available today.
